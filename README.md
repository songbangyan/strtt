# strtt
Segger RTT client using ST-link debugger.

Options:

**-v** debugLevel where debugLevel from -3 to 4 when -3 is equal to silent output

**-ramstart** Ram Start address where the program is looking for RTT( **hex**,dec model supported).

**-ramsize** ramAmmount where ramAmmount is the range where the program is looking for RTT.

**-tcp** use tcp connection to st-link gdb server (<https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-server.html>)

**-ap** select the AP number to use (default 0), some devices have multiple APs, for example STM32H5 and STM32H7 need set AP to 1.

# Executable

Can be found [here](https://github.com/phryniszak/strtt/releases).


# Using with STM32CubeIDE

Thanks to the **-tcp** option it is possible to communicate with a target using the RTT channel while debugging in STM32CubeIDE.
In debug options "Shared ST-LINK" must be checked.

# Using with VSCode and cortex-debug

To share ST-LINK_gdbserver add **-t** option to serverArgs and start strtt with **-tcp**.

# Internals

Program is using a refactored driver from the openocd project.

# Usage example

```bash

# in most cases default settings are OK

./strtt

# If you want to connect to RTT while debugging in your IDE share stlink and use tcp

./strtt -ramstart 0x30020000 -tcp

```

# SYSTEMVIEW

One experimental option is to use this program with Segger SystemView using tcp connection. To use it, the program must be built with the SYSVIEW option.

`cmake -DSYSVIEW=1 ..`

# RTT in browser
You can also try to use web browser version:
